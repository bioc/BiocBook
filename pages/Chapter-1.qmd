# Write a `BiocBook` package

## Creating a `BiocBook` package

## Adding new `BiocBook` pages

## Adding references

## Executing code

It's super easy to execute actual code from any `BiocBook` page when rendering the `BiocBook` website. 

### `R` code

`R` code can be executed and rendered: 

```{r filename="R"}
utils::packageVersion("BiocVersion")
```

### `bash` code

`bash` code can also be executed and rendered: 

```{sh filename="bash"}
ls -l 
```

<!-- 
### `python` code

Finally, `python` code can also be executed and rendered: 

```{python filename="python"}
#| eval: false
import os
os.getcwd()
```

For the rendering of `python` code, you will be limited to 
the `python` packages installed in the Github worker. These packages can be 
listed in the `inst/assets/requirements.txt` file, e.g.: 

```{txt filename="requirements.txt"}
#| eval: false
numpy
pandas >= 2.0.0
```
